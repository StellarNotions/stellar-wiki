# Welcome to the stellar-wiki wiki!

This is a collection of useful code snippets used for a specific purpose. Usually, you use the snippets every once in a while, but it's been long enough that you've likely forgotten the exact syntax, or a workaround you always have to do.

Now, you have a place to record those pesky discoveries, and make it easier to find them again the future, instead of having to hunt down that one article you used last time.
